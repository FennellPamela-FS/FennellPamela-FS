### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my B.S. Degree in Web Development at Full Sail University
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Application Development
- âš¡ Fun fact: I just activated my DevCard on daily.dev which is a cool feed that provides all developer news in one place. The blog focuses on industry leading platforms so that you can be prepared for your next skill. As I read through articles my DevCard will update to show my progress.
